                    Iâ€™m Nishant Sakesh, a final-year Computer Science Engineering student with a passion for turning innovative ideas into reality through Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Full-Stack Web Development. <br> <br>

                    Over the years, Iâ€™ve built a strong foundation in Python programming, data analysis, and web technologies, enabling me to create impactful projects ranging from data-driven applications to dynamic web platforms. I thrive on solving real-world problems and continuously seek opportunities to learn, adapt, and innovate. <br> <br>

                    Iâ€™ve completed hands-on training in AI & ML, worked on exciting projects like Text-to-Image Generation, and honed my skills in tools like Streamlit, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Beyond technical expertise, I bring a problem-solving mindset, collaborative spirit, and a drive to excel in challenging environments. <br> <br>

                    Currently, Iâ€™m actively looking for internship opportunities where I can contribute my knowledge, gain industry exposure, and grow into a well-rounded professional.
